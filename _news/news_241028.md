My teammate, [Seoyong Lee][syleeKR], and I won 1st place in the **Optimization Grand Challenge 2024**, hosted by LG CNS in collaboration with the Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers. The competetion focused on solving real-world challenges through mathematical optimization, and we secured the top spot among 378 teams! ðŸŽ‰ As part of our victory, we took home a prize of 10 million won.
